## Tic Tac Toe Game
A Tic Tac Toe Game (Full Responsive) that can be played by One Player (with Easy And Hard Mode) or two players build using HTML,CSS & Javascript.

## About
This is my very first mini project in javascript built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!. From understanding the basics of JavaScript syntax to applying it in a practical project, every step has been a valuable learning experience.
I'm immensely grateful to Shradha Khapra for her videos. I made this project with the help of those videos and I also add some more functions. While I couldn't add all the functions I envisioned, I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far.
